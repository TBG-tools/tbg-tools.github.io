Hi! I see you want to contribute to the repository! Please read these contributing guidelines before you make a request.
## General rules
**Don't mess up the repository:** Never delete any files without the permission from JackyBorderCollie.
<br>
**Don't put NSFW content:** Please note that NSFW content is for 18+ only. Please avoid using it.
## Contributing rules
**Use correct file extensions:** Pages are made with `.html` extension, and style is made with `.css` extension. JavaScript is put in .html using the `<script>` element.
<br>
**Check your code for errors:** Is your code working correctly? Please test your code before publishing it here.
## Optional
**Use Github Desktop:** This is optional, but is recommended, because it's easier to make folders. Oh, and you can test code in your browser without publishing it!
<br>
**Style your tools:** Again, this is optional, but is recommended, because it looks nice. It's up to you which style you use!
<br>

Now, that's the contributing guidelines! Now you can go ahead and make a request in Issues!
